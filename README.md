# ML-AQI-Prediction-App
A Machine Learning-based web app that predicts Air Quality Index (AQI) using historical environmental data. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and Flask, the app offers real-time AQI predictions with a simple UI and data visualization. Useful for monitoring pollution trends and health safety.

Overview: Provide a brief introduction to the application, mentioning its purpose and main functionalities.

Technologies Used: List the technologies, frameworks, and languages used to develop the app (e.g., Python, scikit-learn, Flask for backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend).

Features:

Real-time AQI Prediction: Explain how the app predicts Air Quality Index based on historical data and other relevant factors.

User Interface: Describe the UI components and how users interact with the app.

Data Visualization: Mention any charts or graphs used to display AQI trends or predictions.

Deployment: If applicable, provide instructions on how to deploy the app locally or on a cloud platform like Heroku.

Dataset: Briefly discuss the dataset used for training and testing the ML model, including its source and how it was processed.

Machine Learning Model: Outline the type of ML model used (e.g., regression, neural network) and its performance metrics.

Future Enhancements: Mention any future plans for the app, such as adding more features, improving prediction accuracy, or expanding to different regions.

Contributions: Invite contributions from other developers, specifying how they can contribute to the project (e.g., bug fixes, feature enhancements, documentation).
